Optimized Prompt
Act as an Agile Expert Team composed of an AI Super Prompt Genius, a Certified Scrum Master (CSM), an Agile Coach, and a Project Metrics Analyst. I am a Delivery Lead with some hands-on Agile experience, attending a Scrum Fundamentals course.

I want to dig deeper into the Scrum methodology, especially to better coach my team of Developers, QA, and Front-End engineers.

My main focus areas are:

Practical understanding and coaching guidance on using:

ðŸ“‰ Burndown Charts

ðŸ“ˆ Burn-up Charts

I need both theoretical knowledge and real-world applications relevant to leading Agile delivery.

Please include visual-style explanations (e.g., describing what charts look like, how they evolve over a sprint, and what patterns to look for).

I am especially interested in tips on how to interpret these charts, identify anti-patterns, and use them to coach the team effectively.

Format is flexible â€“ use whatever best combines clarity, visual mental models, and actionable insight.

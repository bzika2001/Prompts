Optimized Prompt
Act as an expert Agile team, combining the skills of an AI Super Prompt Genius, a Certified Scrum Master (CSM), an Agile Coach, and a Project Metrics Analyst.

I am a Delivery Lead with moderate hands-on Agile experience, attending a Scrum fundamentals course. My goal is to deepen my theoretical understanding and gain practical, coaching-ready knowledge about Scrum, especially around Burndown and Burn-up charts.

Here's what I need in the output:

Clear explanations of both Burndown and Burn-up charts, with emphasis on:

Their purpose in Scrum

How to interpret them

Typical anti-patterns to coach against

How to use them effectively during Daily Standups, Reviews, and Retros

Include real-world coaching advice relevant to leading a team of Developers, QA, and Front-End Engineers.

Provide visual mental models of both charts (describe them vividly or include ASCII/markdown-style visuals if images are not possible).

Add sample graphs or templates to show how these charts typically look and how progress and issues manifest visually.

Help me communicate these insights effectively to both the Scrum Team and stakeholders.

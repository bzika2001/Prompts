As an Agile Coach, Project Management Consultant, and Curriculum Designer, teach me—an IT Delivery Lead—everything I need to master the Kanban methodology. My goal is to introduce and adopt Kanban within my beginner-level IT team (Developers, Back-End Developers, QA) to improve delivery speed and clarify the differences between Scrum and Kanban.

The content should be structured, educational, and progressive, covering both theoretical foundations and practical application, and tailored for Azure DevOps adoption. Include:

Introduction to Kanban and its four basic principles

Overview of a Kanban Board and how it functions

Explanation of Kanban Cards and their role

The Six General Practices of Kanban

Key Kanban Metrics (Cycle Time, Lead Time, Throughput, WIP)

How metrics vary by board type

Live-style demos or explanations using:

Trello

Jira

Standard Kanban Board Statuses

Use and benefits of Kanban Swimlanes

Step-by-step guide to implementing Kanban in a real IT team

The role of a Delivery Lead in driving, managing, and optimizing Kanban adoption and flow

The explanation should include real-world IT-specific examples and scenarios relevant to developers, QA, and back-end workflows. Present everything in a way that helps me become confident in mentoring my team, managing delivery, and optimizing throughput via Kanban.
